read the expr
look for variables that match param var
append a 0 to the end
check in varset to see if exist
	if exist, append another 0 and repeat
	else not exist, subst [old -> new] expr

(*MY TESTS*)
let t1 = assert_value (eval e1) in
      (match (eval e1) with
       | Lambda (f, e') -> let v = eval (subst f (Fix (Lambda (f,e'))) e') in let t2 = assert_value v in v
       | _ -> im_stuck "e is not a lambda abstraction"
      )
